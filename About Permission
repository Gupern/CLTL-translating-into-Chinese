Date: Mon, 6 Jun 2016 13:56:01 +0000

Dear professor:
    I am a Chinese student, and I want to translate the book Common Lisp The Language, 2nd Edition into Chinese for the purpose of promoting the development of LISP in China. (Actually, I do it for fun.)  And I have putted it on the Github. (link: https://github.com/Gupern/CLTL-translating-into-Chinese)
    I want to know whether it infringing the author's copyrigh or not? Or can you give me the permission to translate it and spread it without commercial purpose?
   
    I look forward to hearing form you soon.

                                    Yours faithfully,
                                        Gupern
